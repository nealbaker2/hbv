 · This could be the reason the reason. If a dog coughs up right after drinking water may be a sign that a harmful substance is present in water which caused the dog to cough reflex. Perhaps it’s related to a serious health issue. Whatever the reason an appointment to the vet isn’t a bad idea but it will provide you with confidence in knowing. Cats enjoy moving water and will not drink stagnant or stale water. Even water in a dish far away from food or litter pans rapidly forms a biofilm that some cats dislike. 1. Poor Senses Cats have a blind spot immediately in front of their snout, indicating that they have poor depth perception. It could be cat hair that's irritating the throat/esophogus. It could be the way your cat drinks -- maybe she drinks too quickly or has a peculiar way of swallowing. If this is not new -- if she has been doing this her whole life or even for the last year or so-- and she doesn't do this when she eats, I wouldn't worry.
